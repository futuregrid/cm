This project is part of FutureGrid and can be used currently on the 
OpenStack cloud of FutureGrid. To apply for an account, please 
go to https://portal.futuregrid.org 

However you laso need to apply for a project in case you like to use FG resources.
If you have your own OpenStack cloud you naturally do not need to pply for a FG account.
